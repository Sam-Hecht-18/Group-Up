# Group-Up

This is a group project completed by Sam Hecht, Eli Forman, Seth Richards, and Vik Miller for our 
Computer Science Seminar course in my junior year of high school.

The app was designed to allow people to create events, and for other people to sign up or 
"Group-Up" for the events. In this way, users could organize pick-up sporting events,
study sessions, or anything in between, inviting either their friends or anyone to come and join
them.
